- the ad hoc command line can be used directly
> ansible localhost -m ping (-m module)
> ansible localhost -a "echo 'Hello automated World'" (-a argument)
> ansible 192.168.10.10 -a "apt update" -u setup --become  (-u remote user)
> ansible 192.168.10.10 -a "whoami" -u setup --become --become-user user1

- having all Ansible configuration files located in a folder within the home directory of the user.

- host and group variables
Hosts can also have their variables stored in a YAML file. By default, this is located in the /etc/ansible/host_vars/
	- host
	ansible_user: <user>: defines which user Ansible will be using to manage the host (like -u)
	ansible_host: <ip or hostname>: 
	ansible_connection: ssh or others
	ansible_port: port_num 
	ansible_become: 
	ansible_become_user: <user>: This allows Ansible to run a command as a specific user other than the remote access user.
	ansible_ssh_pass:
	ansible_ssh_private_key_file: <path/to/file>

	- group
	they can be defined in two ways, either on the inventory file or on separate files
	By default, Ansible looks for them in the /etc/ansible/group_vars/ folder.
	[labserver]
	node0.lab.edu
	node1.lab.edu

	[labserver:vars]
	ansible_connection=ssh
	ansible_port=22
