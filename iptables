CHAIN RULE
the sets of rules are called chains and the rules are applied in order, there are five filtering points process packets:
1.PREROUTING handles packets before the routing decision process.
2.INPUT handles packets destined for the local system.
3.FORWARD handles packets being forwarded to a remote system.
4.OUTPUT handles packets output from the local system
5.POSTROUTING handles packets being sent to remote systems, after the forward filter.

TABLE
Each chain contains tables that define rules for handling the packets
1.FILTER applies rules to allow or block packets from exiting the chain.
2.MANGLE applies rules to change features of the packets before they exit the chain.
3.NAT applies rules to change the addresses of the packets before they exit the chain.

TARGET
Normally when a rule matches, no additional rules are tested and the chain exits
each chain has a target policy value. The policy target defines how packets are handled by default for the chain when no rules 
apply to the packet
there are built-in policy and extended policy 
1.Accept: built-in
2.DROP: built-in
3.LOG: extended
4.REJECT: extended
